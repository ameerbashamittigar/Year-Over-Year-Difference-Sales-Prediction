In this Projcet I have tackled the challenge of predicting year-over-year changes in sales revenue, employing machine learning models and data analytics. This problem is vital for businesses
to plan resourceseffectively and reach their sales targets. By analyzing historical sales data and incorporating factors like seasonality and marketing campaigns,I've developed expertise
in regression modeling and forecasting, aiming to provide actionable insights for business growth.

Predictive models like the random effects model and linear mixed effects allow publishers to identify which factors are most influential in running their business and driving decisions, 
allowing them to focus on areas with tremendous growth potential. These predictions enable publishers to make more accurate revenue forecasts, plan budgets, and allocate resources more effectively. 

Running with the idea and based on the prior research, with their historical data, predicting their revenue and game count helps publishers make improved business decisions, assess the overall performance,
and better understand the impact of various factors on game counts, including past performance, genre trends, and pricing strategy.
